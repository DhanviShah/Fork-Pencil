# Fork & Pencil

## Outline  :
#### This was done as a part of the project for the course : Software Project Management. The aim of this project is to provide a one stop solution in the form of a website named "Fork & Pencil" where users can check the nutritional values of various food items such as calories, proteins, carbs, etc., search for their recipes and also add the new recipes and their nutritional information. 
#### In the current scenario, seeing people ignoring their health by eating staples, this project was developed to provide nutritional information and recipes which help people maintain better food eating habits and monitor a balanced energy level.
